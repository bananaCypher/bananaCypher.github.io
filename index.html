    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an enthusiastic, self-motivated person who is always looking for a challenge.  I had been a hobbyist programmer since I left school and after working on a Service Desk for 3 years have decided to pursue it as a career.  I have recently started a programming course called <a href="http://www.codeclan.com/">CodeClan</a> which I hope will help me expand my skills and open up job opertunities.  I have dabbled around with C# and Visual Basic but mainly program using Ruby and Python, I am also competent with web technologies like HTML, CSS and JS along with web frameworks in both Ruby and Python.</p>
